Question 2: Throughout the question, I first decided to create instance variables to hold values of team1 name, team2 name, team1 score, and team2 score. After a while, I've considered that I required a variable to track whose turn it was when the code executed methods like recordPlay or getScore, I decided to use a boolean variable as it seemed the most direct and obvious in the context of the variable to decide whether team 1 or team 2 should acquire the score that is earned at the current round where a true value indicated that team 1 was active and team 2 otherwise.
