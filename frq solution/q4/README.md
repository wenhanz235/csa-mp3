Question 4: In this question, I first struggled by questioning myself certain cases that may make the code more complicated like what if the two neighbors had the same value or if the input location is at the last row and last column, though, after looking carefully at the question, I noticed that this was impossible. After this, I proceed to think about the result that should be executed due to certain conditions for the neighbors, for example, if only one neighbor exist then that neighbor will be returned. I used the length of the row and column in the 2d array to compare with the input row and column value to determine if there was any possibility of them being in the most bottom or most right. In addition, for second part, I kind of struggled with the condition for the while loop as I first thought of using an and statement to track for the row and column value of the location object to not be on most bottom right corner, though, this may result in early end to the while loop as it shouldn't end when only one value either the row or column is at the end. After careful consideration, I've convinced myself to use multiplication as only if the location is at the bottom right corner then its row and column value will equal the original length of rows and column of the 2d array.
