Question 3: Throughout the question, I went ahead and thought about the condtions that they wanted the code to execute in which is where the previous string exist in the next one, this allowed me to create an if to coordinate any possibilites of fails to this condition to return a false value. In addition, in the second part, I've considered the impact that deleting the target string from the strings in the list would do, I figured that if the target had the same exact value as the string at the current index in the list then it would become empty. I came to realize that if the string at the index is longer than the target string then it would began to add the part that is after the target string portion in the overall string, so I utilized the length of the target string to start at the correct index to acquire the correct values.
